# Machine-Learning Using R Programming

Logistic Regression in Machine Learning Sample Application

The idea is to use Logistic Regression technique of Machine learning to track the delay status of Flights with in Major Cities in USA.

Data is Scraped from : Department of Transporation [US Government Transportation Data].

The Major Factors that are taken in to consideration includes : Flight arrival and destination delays.

As a future Enhancement, Algorithm Performance can be improved by integrating the dataset with Weather Dataset which could give us Real-Time updates.
